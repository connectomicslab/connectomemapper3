    abstract = {Abstract Many studies focused on the cortical representations of fingers, while the palm is relatively neglected despite its importance for hand function. Here, we investigated palm representation (PR) and its relationship with finger representations (FRs) in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Few studies in humans suggested that PR is located medially with respect to FRs in S1, yet to date, no study directly quantified the somatotopic organization of PR and the five FRs. Importantly, the link between the somatotopic organization of PR and FRs and their activation properties remains largely unexplored. Using 7T fMRI, we mapped PR and the five FRs at the single subject level. First, we analyzed the cortical distance between PR and FRs to determine their somatotopic organization. Results show that PR was located medially with respect to D5. Second, we tested whether the observed cortical distances would predict the relationship between PR and FRs activations. Using three complementary measures (cross-activations, pattern similarity and resting-state connectivity), we show that the relationship between PR and FRs activations were not determined by their somatotopic organization, that is, there was no gradient moving from D5 to D1, except for resting-state connectivity, which was predicted by the somatotopy. Instead, we show that the representational geometry of PR and FRs activations reflected the physical structure of the hand. Collectively, our findings suggest that the spatial proximity between topographically organized neuronal populations do not necessarily predicts their functional properties, rather the structure of the sensory space (e.g., the hand shape) better describes the observed results.},

    abstract = {The functional organization of neural processes is constrained by the brain's intrinsic structural connectivity, i.e., the connectome. Here, we explore how structural connectivity can improve the representation of brain activity signals and their dynamics. Using a multi-modal imaging dataset (electroencephalography, structural MRI, and diffusion MRI), we represent electrical brain activity at the cortical surface as a time-varying composition of harmonic modes of structural connectivity. These harmonic modes are known as connectome harmonics. Here we describe brain activity signal as a time-varying combination of connectome harmonics. We term this description as the connectome spectrum of the signal. We found that: first, the brain activity signal is represented more compactly by the connectome spectrum than by the traditional area-based representation; second, the connectome spectrum characterizes fast brain dynamics in terms of signal broadcasting profile, revealing different temporal regimes of integration and segregation that are consistent across participants. And last, the connectome spectrum characterizes fast brain dynamics with fewer degrees of freedom than area-based signal representations. Specifically, we show that a smaller number of dimensions capture the differences between low-level and high-level visual processing in the connectome spectrum. Also, we demonstrate that connectome harmonics capture more sensitively the topological properties of brain activity. In summary, this work provides statistical, functional, and topological evidence indicating that the description of brain activity in terms of structural connectivity fosters a more comprehensive understanding of large-scale dynamic neural functioning.}

                    relationship between structural (SC) and functional connectivity (FC),
                    integrative and multimodal approaches to combine the two remain limited. Here,
                    we propose a new adaptive filter for estimating dynamic and directed FC using
                    structural connectivity information as priors. We tested the filter in rat

                    meta-analysis of tracer studies and diffusion tensor imaging metrics,
                    respectively. We show that, particularly under conditions of low signal-to-noise
                    ratio, SC priors can help to refine estimates of directed FC, promoting sparse
                    functional networks that combine information from structure and function. In
                    addition, the proposed filter provides intrinsic protection against SC-related
                    false negatives, as well as robustness against false positives, representing a

  abstract = {We describe the multimodal neuroimaging dataset VEPCON (OpenNeuro Dataset ds003505). It includes raw data and derivatives of high-density EEG, structural MRI, diffusion weighted images (DWI) and single-trial behavior (accuracy, reaction time). Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded while participants (n = 20) discriminated briefly presented faces from scrambled faces, or coherently moving stimuli from incoherent ones. EEG and MRI were recorded separately from the same participants. The dataset contains raw EEG and behavioral data, pre-processed EEG of single trials in each condition, structural MRIs, individual brain parcellations at 5 spatial resolutions (83 to 1015 regions), and the corresponding structural connectomes computed from fiber count, fiber density, average fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps. For source imaging, VEPCON provides EEG inverse solutions based on individual anatomy, with Python and Matlab scripts to derive activity time-series in each brain region, for each parcellation level. The BIDS-compatible dataset can contribute to multimodal methods development, studying structure-function relations, and to unimodal optimization of source imaging and graph analyses, among many other possibilities.},

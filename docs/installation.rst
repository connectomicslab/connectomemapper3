The Connectome Mapper 3 is composed of a Docker image, namely the Connectome Mapper 3 BIDS App, and a Python Graphical User Interface, namely the Connectome Mapper BIDS App Manager.

*   Installation instructions for the Connectome mapper 3 BIDS App are found in :ref:`manual-install-cmpbidsapp`.
*   Installation instructions for the Connectome mapper 3 BIDS App Manager are found in :ref:`manual-install-cmpbidsappmanager`.

..
    The steps to add the NeuroDebian repository are explained at http://neuro.debian.net/ .

Make sure that you have installed the following prerequisites.

.. important::

    On Mac and Windows, if you want to track the carbon emission incurred by the processing with the ``--track_carbon_footprint`` option flag, you will need to install in addition the `Intel Power Gadget` tool available `here <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/power-gadget.html>`_.


The Connectome Mapper 3 BIDSApp
===============================

.. _manual-install-docker:

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Install Docker Engine depending of your system:

    *   For Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/18.04, follow the instructions at
        https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

    *   For Mac OSX (>=10.10.3), get the .dmg installer at
        https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac

    *   For Windows (>=10), get the installer at
        https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows

.. note:: Connectome Mapper 3 BIDSApp has been tested only on Ubuntu and MacOSX.
        In principles, it should also run on Windows but it might require a few patches
        to make it work.


*   Manage Docker as a non-root user

    *   Open a terminal

    *   Create the docker group::

            $ sudo groupadd docker

    *   Add the current user to the docker group::

            $ sudo usermod -G docker -a $USER

    *   Reboot

    *   After reboot, test if docker is managed as non-root::

            $ docker run hello-world


.. _manual-install-cmpbidsapp:

Installation
---------------------------------------

Installation of the Connectome Mapper 3 has been facilitated through the distribution of a BIDSApp relying on the Docker software container technology.

*   Open a terminal

*   Download and extract the latest release (|release|) of the BIDS App:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ docker pull sebastientourbier/connectomemapper-bidsapp:|release|
    
.. note:: This can take a little bit of time depending on your connection speed and your machine.
          The docker image of the BIDSApp has a compressed size of 6.28 GB on `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/sebastientourbier/connectomemapper-bidsapp/tags>`_ and should take 17.6 GB of space on your machine after download and extraction.

*   To display all docker images available::

        $ docker images

    You should see the docker image "connectomemapper-bidsapp" with tag "|release|" is now available.

*   You are ready to use the Connectome Mapper 3 BIDS App from the terminal. See its `commandline usage <usage.html>`_.

The Connectome Mapper 3 BIDSApp Manager (GUI)
==============================================

Prerequisites
---------------

*   Download the Python 3 installer of miniconda3 corresponding to your 32/64bits MacOSX/Linux/Win system and
    install it following the instructions at `https://conda.io/miniconda.html <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.

.. _manual-install-cmpbidsappmanager:

Installation
---------------------------------------
The installation of the Connectome Mapper 3, including `cmpbidsappmanager`, consists of the creation of conda environment with all python dependencies installed, and the installation of `connectomemapper` via the Python Package Index (PyPI) as follows:

*   Download the appropriate `environment.yml <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/raw/master/conda/environment.yml>`_ / `environment_macosx.yml <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/raw/master/conda/environment_macosx.yml>`_.

    .. important::
        It seems there is no conda package for `git-annex` available on Mac.
        For your convenience, we created an additional `conda/environment_macosx.yml`
        miniconda3 environment where the line `- git-annex=XXXXXXX` has been removed.
        Git-annex should be installed on MacOSX using `brew <https://brew.sh/index_fr>`_
        i.e. ``brew install git-annex``. See https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/ for more details.

        Note that `git-annex` is only necessary if you wish to use BIDS datasets managed by Datalad (`https://www.datalad.org/ <https://www.datalad.org/>`_).

*   Open a terminal.

*   Create a miniconda3 environment where all python dependencies will be installed::

        $ conda env create -f /path/to/downloaded/conda/environment[_macosx].yml

    .. note:: This can take a little bit of time depending on your connection speed and your machine.
              You should also expect that it would take a space of around 2.8GB on your machine.

*   Activate the conda environment::

        $ source activate py37cmp-gui

  or::

        $ conda activate py37cmp-gui

*   Install finally the latest released version of Connectome Mapper 3 with the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`::

        (py37cmp-gui)$ pip install connectomemapper

*   You are ready to use the Connectome Mapper 3 (1) via its Graphical User Interface (GUI) aka CMP BIDS App Manager
    (See :ref:`guiusage` for the user guide), (2) via its python ``connectomemapper3_docker`` and
    ``connectomemapper3_singularity`` wrappers (See :ref:`wrapperusage` for commandline usage), or (3) by
    interacting directly with the Docker / Singularity Engine (See :ref:`containerusage` for commandline usage).

.. admonition:: In the future

    If you wish to update Connectome Mapper 3 and the Connectome Mapper 3 BIDS App Manager,
    this could be easily done by running `pip install connectomemapper==v3.X.Y`.

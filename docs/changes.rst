****************************
Version 3.1.0
****************************

Date: MM DD, 2022

This version fully integrates the new pipeline dedicated to EEG modality inside the BIDS App and the GUI.

**What's Changed**

*Updates*

*   The conda environment files for `cmpbidsappmanager`
    (``conda/environment.yml`` and ``conda/environment_macosx.yml``) have been greatly modified
    (`PR #212 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/212>`_).
    This includes the following updates:

    *   `python`: from ``3.7`` to ``3.9``
    *   `pip`: from ``21.3.1`` to ``22.2``
    *   `indexed_gzip`: from ``1.6.4`` to ``1.6.13``
    *   `git-annex` (``conda/environment.yml`` only): from ``8.20211123`` to ``10.20220724``
    *   `qt/pyqt` ``5.15.4`` installed via `conda-forge`
    *   `pyqt5-sip` ``12.9.0`` (version compatible with `qt/pyqt` ``5.15.4``) installed via `conda-forge`

    In addition, the created environment has been renamed `py39cmp-gui` to be consistent
    with the new python version installed in the environment.

*   In all conda environment `*.yml` and `requirements.txt` files, datalad and its container extension have
    been updated to the following versions
    (`PR #209 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/209>`_):

    *   `datalad`: from ``0.15.4`` to ``0.17.2``
        (See `Datalad changelog <http://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/changelog.html>`_ for more details).

    *   `datalad-container`: from ``1.1.5`` to ``1.1.6``

*New features*

*   The new pipeline dedicated to EEG modality has been integrated into the BIDS App
    and `cmpbidsappmanager`
    (`PR #201 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/201>`_ and
    `PR #205 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/205>`_).
    EEG pipeline configuration files are passed to the BIDS
    App or its docker/singularity python wrapper via the option flag `--eeg_pipeline`.
    A new tab has been added to the configurator window of `cmpbidsappmanager` for
    the setup and saving of configuration files for the EEG pipeline. A new tab has
    also been added to the output inspector window of `cmpbidsappmanager` to enable
    the visual inspection of outputs generated by the EEG pipeline. The EEG
    configuration file can now be specified in the BIDS App interface window of
    `cmpbidsappmanager` and the command to run the BIDS has been updated. A new
    `EEGConnectomeStage` stage has been implemented that builds the connectivity
    matrices from the extracted ROI time-series using the function
    `spectral_connectivity_epochs <https://mne.tools/mne-connectivity/stable/generated/mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_epochs.html>`_ of
    MNE Connectivity. A new utility script `visualize_eeg_pipeline_outputs.py` has been
    implemented in the `cmp/cli` module, which is called by the output inspector window
    of `cmpbidsappmanager`.

*   Option to apply or not band-pass filtering in fMRI pipeline.
    (`PR #200 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/200>`_)

*Code refactoring*

*   Major refactoring of all the code related to the EEG pipeline
    (`PR #198 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/198>`_).
    This includes:

    *   Renaming `EEGLoaderStage` to `EEGPreprocessingStage`,
    *   Refactoring inputs/outputs of all interfaces of `cmtklib.eeg`,
        `cmtklib.interfaces.mne`, and `cmtklib.interfaces.pycartool` modules
    *   Refactoring of all inputs, outputs, and config traits of the different stages
    *   Modification of (1) `cmp.pipelines.functional.eeg.py` and (2) the tutorial
        notebook for the EEG pipeline that integrates all previously mentioned changes

*Bug fix*

*   Problems to install and launch cmpbidsappmanager on Ubuntu. (`PR #212 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/212>`_)

*   Fix nibabel to `3.2.2` as the imported functions of `nibabel.trackvis` has been moved since `4.0.0` and caused errors.
    (`PR #XX <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/XX>`_)

*   Fix problem of traits not updated while making the diffusion pipeline config with ACT.
    (`PR #200 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/200>`_)

*Documentation*

*   Update/add documentation for the EEG pipeline
    (`PR #208 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/208>`_).

****************************
Version 3.0.2
****************************

Date: Jan 31, 2021

This version mostly introduces the capability to estimate carbon footprint of CMP3 execution and fix problem of conflicts during the creation of the conda environment.
It incorporates in particular the following changes.

*New features*

*   Allow the estimation of the carbon footprint while using the BIDS App python wrappers and the GUI.
    Estimations are conducted using `codecarbon <https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon>`_. All functions supporting
    this features have been implemented in the new module :py:mod:`cmtklib.carbonfootprint`.
    See `PR #136 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/136>`_ for more details.

*Code changes*

*   Creation of ``init_subject_derivatives_dirs()`` for ``AnatomicalPipeline``, ``DifusionPipeline``, and ``fMRIPipeline``
    that return the paths to Nipype and CMP derivatives folders of a given subject / session for a given pipeline.
    This removed all the implicated code from the ``process()`` method and improve modularity and readability.
    In the future, the different functions could be merged as there is a lot of code duplication between them.

*   ``AnatomicalPipeline``, ``DiffusionPipeline``, and ``fMRIPipeline`` workflows are run with the `MultiProc` plugin.

*Bug fix*

*   Major update of the ``conda/environment.yml`` and ``conda/environment_macosx.yml`` to correct the problems of conflicts in the previous version,
    as reported in `issue #137 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/issues/137>`_. This has resulted in the following package updates:

    *   `pip`: 20.1.1 -> 21.3.1

*Documentation*

*   Add description of carbon footprint estimation feature.

*   Improve description on how to use already computed Freesurfer derivatives.

*Misc*

*   Clean the resources related to parcellation in ``cmtklib/data/parcellation`` and rename all files and mentions of lausanne2008 to lausanne2018.

*   Removed unused ``cmtklib.interfaces.camino``, ``cmtklib.interfaces.camino2trackvis``,
    and ``cmtklib.interfaces.diffusion`` modules

*   Specify to `Coverage.py` with ``# pragma: no cover`` part of the code we know it won’t be executed

*   Create and use a `.coveragerc` file to set the run of `Coverage.py` with `--concurrency=multiprocessing`
    to be allow to track code inside Nipype interfaces, now managed by multiprocessing.

*Code style*

*   Correct a number of code style issues with class names.

****************************
Version 3.0.1
****************************

Date: Jan 05, 2021

This version is mostly a bug fix release that allows the python packages of Connectome Mapper 3 to be available on PyPI.
It incorporates `Pull Request #132 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/132>`_ which includes the following changes.

*Bug fix*

*   Rename the project name in `setup.py` and `setup_pypi.py` from `"cmp"` to `"connectomemapper"`.
    Such a `"cmp"` project name was already existing on PyPI, that caused continuous integration on CircleCI to fail during the last `v3.0.0` release, while uploading the python packages of CMP3 to PyPI.

*Code refactoring*

*   Make `cmp.bidsappmanager.gui.py` more lightweight by splitting the classes defined there in different files.
    (See `Issue #129 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/issues/129>`_ for more discussion details)

*   Split the `create_workflow()` method of the `RegistrationStage` into the `create_ants_workflow()`, `create_flirt_workflow()`, and `create_bbregister_workflow()`.
    (See `Issue #95 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/issues/95>`_ for more discussion details)

*Code style*

*   Correct a number of code style issues with class names

*Contributors*

*   `Sebastien Tourbier <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/issues?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asebastientourbier>`_

****************************
Version 3.0.0
****************************

Date: Dec 24, 2021

This version corresponds to the first official release of Connectome Mapper 3 (CMP3).
It incorporates `Pull Request #88 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/88>`_ (>450 commits)
which includes the following changes.

*Updates*

*   traits has been updated from `6.0.0` to `6.2.0`.
*   traitsui has been updated from `6.1.3` to `7.0.0`.
*   pybids has been updated from `0.10.2` to `0.14.0`.
*   nipype has been updated to `1.5.1` to `1.7.0`.
*   dipy has been updated from `1.1.0` to `1.3.0`.
*   obspy has been updated from `1.2.1` to `1.2.2`.

*New features*

*   CMP3 can take custom segmentation (brain, white-matter, gray-matter and
    CSF masks, Freesurfer's aparcaseg - used for ACT for PFT) and parcellation
    files as long as they comply to `BIDS Derivatives specifications <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/05-derivatives/01-introduction.html>`_,
    by providing the label value for the different entity in the filename.
    This has led to the creation of the new module :py:mod:`cmtklib.bids.io`,
    which provides different classes to represent the diversity of custom input
    BIDS-formatted files.
    (`PR #88 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/88>`_)

*   CMP3 generates generic label-index mapping `.tsv` files along with the parcellation
    files, in accordance to
    `BIDS derivatives <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/05-derivatives/03-imaging.html#common-image-derived-labels>`_.
    This has led to the creation of the :py:class:`~cmtklib.bids.utils.CreateBIDSStandardParcellationLabelIndexMappingFile`
    and :py:class:`~cmtklib.bids.utils.CreateCMPParcellationNodeDescriptionFilesFromBIDSFile` interfaces, which allows us to
    create the BIDS label-index mapping file from the parcellation node description files employed
    by CMP3 (that includes `_FreeSurferColorLUT.txt` and `_dseg.graphml`), and vice versa.

*   CMP3 provide python wrappers to the Docker and Singularity container images
    (`connectomemapper3_docker` and `connectomemapper3_singularity`)
    that will generate and execute the appropriate command to run the BIDS App.
    (`PR #109 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/109>`_,
      `PR #115 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/115>`_,
      `PR #130 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/130>`_)

*Major changes*

*   Lausanne2018 parcellation has completely replaced the old Lausanne2008 parcellation.
    In brief, the new parcellation was introduced to provide (1) symmetry of labels
    between hemispheres, and (2) a more optimal generation of the volumetric parcellation images,
    that now are generated at once from `.annot` files. This fixes the issue of overwritten labels
    encountered by in the process of creating the Lausanne2008 parcellation. Any code and data
    related to Lausanne2008 has been removed. If one still wish to use this old parcellation scheme,
    one should use CMP3 (`v3.0.0-RC4`).

*Output updates*

*   Directories for the derivatives produced by cmp (`cmp`, `freesurfer`, `nipype`)
    were renamed to `cmp-<cmp_version>`,  `freesurfer-<freesurfer_version>`, and
    `nipype-<nipype_version>` to comply with BIDS 1.4.0+.
    (`PR #3 (fork) <https://github.com/sebastientourbier/connectomemapper3/pull/3>`_)

*Code refactoring*

*   Creation in `AnatomicalPipeline`, `DiffusionPipeline`, `fMRIPipeline` of
    `create_datagrabber_node()` and `create_datasinker_node()` methods to
    reduce the code in `create_workflow()`.

*   The `run(command)` function of `cmp.bidsappmanager.core` has been moved to
    :py:mod:`cmtklib.process`, which is used by the python wrappers in `cmp.cli`.

*Pipeline Improvements*

*   Better handle of existing Freesurfer outputs. In this case, CMP3 does not
    re-create the `mri/orig/001.mgz` and connect the reconall interface anymore.

*   Creation of 5TT, gray-matter / white-matter interface, and partial volume maps images
    are performed in the preprocessing stage of the diffusion pipeline only if
    necessary

*Code Style*

*   Clean code and remove a number of commented lines that are now obsolete.
    Code related to the connection of nodes in the Nipype `Workflow` adopts a
    specific format and are protected from being reformatted by BLACK with
    the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` tags.

*Documentation*

*   Add instructions to use custom segmentation and parcellation files as inputs.

*   Add description in contributing page of format for code related to
    the connection of the nodes in a Nipype `Workflow`.

*   Add instructions to use the python wrappers for running the BIDS App.
    (`PR #115 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/115>`_)

*   Add notification about the removal of the old Lausanne2008 parcellation, and
    remove any other mentions in the documentation.

*Software container*

*   Define multiple build stages in Dockerfile, which can be run in parallel at build
    with BUILDKIT.
    (`PR #88 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/88>`_)

*Software development life cycle*

*   Update the list of outputs of circleci tests with the new names of
    directories produced by cmp in `output_dir/`.

*   Following major changes in the pricing plans of CircleCI but also to improve its readability,
    `.circleci/config.yml` has been dramatically refactored, including:
    *   Use BUILDKIT in docker build to take advantage of the multi-stage build
    *   Reordering and modularization of the tests:
        *   tests 01-02 (Docker): anatomical pipeline for each parcellation scheme
        *   tests 03-06 (Docker): diffusion pipeline for dipy/mrtrix deterministic/probabilistic tractography
        *   tests 07-08 (Docker): fMRI pipeline for FLIRT and BBRegistration registrations
        *   test 09 (Singularity): anatomical pipeline for Lausanne2018 scheme
    *   Creation of commands for steps that are shared between jobs to reduce code duplication
    (`PR #88 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/88>`_)

  Configuration files in the old `INI` format can be converted automatically
  with the help of the two new methods `check_configuration_format()`
  and `convert_config_ini_2_json()` to detect if configuration files are
  in the `INI` format and to make the conversion.
  (`PR #76 <https://github.com/connectomicslab/connectomemapper3/pull/76>`_)

  have been merged into one `setup.py` and a major refactoring to make
  `pip` happy, as well as the creation of a new `cmp.cli` module,
  migration to `cmp.cli` module and refactoring of the scripts
  `connectomemapper3`, `showmatrix_gpickle`, and `cmpbidsappmanager`
  with correction of code style issues and addition of missing docstrings.
